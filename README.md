# Face Detection Comparison
This project demonstrates a comparison of different face detection techniques using OpenCV in Python. The following techniques are implemented and compared:

-> Haar Cascades

-> OpenCV Deep Learning-based Face Detection

-> ResNet SSD Face Detection

## Comparison of Face Detection Techniques

In summary, the "best" method depends on your specific requirements and constraints. If speed and resource usage are critical, Haar Cascades might be preferred. For higher accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging conditions, deep learning-based methods such as OpenCV DNN or ResNet SSD would be more suitable. It's recommended to evaluate these methods based on your specific use case and performance requirements.

If you want accurate and less errors it have to use Deeplearning-based method and resNet SSD and if you are working with small data and need the output quick it is Haar Cascades model

Requirements

-> Python (>= 3.6)

-> OpenCV (>= 4.0)
